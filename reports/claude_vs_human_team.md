# Claude vs. Human Team Productivity Analysis

## Parameters
- Human team: 15 people
- Work period: 1 year (52 weeks)
- Work hours per person per week: 40 hours
- Velocity ratio: 1.5 hours of Claude work = 2-3 weeks of human work (using the average of 2.5 weeks)

## Calculations

### Total Human Team Work Hours
- 15 people × 40 hours/week × 52 weeks = 31,200 human work hours per year

### Converting to Claude Equivalent
- 2.5 weeks of human work (1 person) = 2.5 weeks × 40 hours = 100 human hours
- Velocity ratio: 1.5 hours of Claude work = 100 human hours
- Conversion factor: 100 human hours ÷ 1.5 Claude hours = 66.67 efficiency multiplier

### Claude Work Time Estimate
- 31,200 human work hours ÷ 66.67 = 468 Claude work hours

## Results

A team of 15 people working for one full year (31,200 human work hours) would be equivalent to approximately **468 hours of Claude work**.

### Time Breakdown
- ~19.5 days of continuous 24/7 Claude operation
- ~58.5 days of Claude working 8 hours per day
- ~11.7 weeks of Claude working 40 hours per week

## Considerations
- This analysis assumes consistent productivity across all types of tasks
- Some tasks may be more amenable to AI acceleration than others
- Quality and testing considerations may add additional time
- Complex coordination and project management aspects might not scale linearly
- The estimate does not account for context switching, training, or communication overhead in the human team

## Conclusion
Using Claude could potentially reduce the equivalent of a 15-person team's annual workload from 52 weeks to approximately 12 weeks, representing a theoretical productivity increase of over 4X when measured in raw output hours.
