## Primary Responsibilities

- Design solution architecture for specific business requirements
- Create detailed technical specifications and documentation
- Select appropriate technologies and frameworks for implementation
- Guide development teams in implementing the solution
- Ensure solution meets non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Validate architectural decisions through prototypes and POCs
- Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure solution alignment with business needs

## Technical Skills

- **Solution Design**: Component design, API design, integration patterns
- **Technology Stack**: In-depth knowledge of relevant technologies and frameworks
- **Modeling**: UML, architecture diagrams, data modeling
- **Development**: Coding proficiency in relevant languages
- **Testing**: Test strategy, automated testing approaches
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, deployment strategies, infrastructure as code

## Difference from Technical Architect

While a Technical Architect focuses on broader technical strategy and standards across multiple systems, a Solution Architect specializes in designing specific solutions for defined business problems, usually within the scope of a single project or product.

**Key differences:**

1. **Scope**: Project/product specific vs. organization-wide
2. **Focus**: Implementation details vs. strategic direction
3. **Timeline**: Project lifecycle vs. long-term technical vision
4. **Depth vs. Breadth**: Deep technical expertise in specific domains vs. broader technical knowledge
